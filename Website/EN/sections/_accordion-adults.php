			<h3>Chinese (in Mandarin) courses for adults</h3>
			<p>We offer courses that are also suitable for adults (成人). The lessons for adults have a structure that assumes that the lessons are regularly attended and that homework and tests are also done. This is the only way to benefit from the lessons. No knowledge of Chinese is required for these courses. Someone who already knows some Chinese can enter at a higher level, in consultation with the school management.</p>
